# Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning 

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **customer churn in the banking domain** using machine learning. The goal is to identify whether a bank customer is likely to leave the bank based on their demographic, account, and financial information. Such predictions help banks take proactive actions to improve customer retention.

This is an **end-to-end Python machine learning project**, covering data preparation, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction on new customer data.
